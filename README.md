# Codex Intel Rebuilder

This project allows you to port the official Arm64 (Apple Silicon) Codex Desktop App to run on Intel Macs.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js**: Installed on your system.
2.  **Codex CLI**: You must have the official `@openai/codex` CLI installed globally, as we need its x64 binary.
    ```bash
    npm install -g @openai/codex
    ```
3.  **Codex.dmg**: The official Arm64 installer (place it in this directory).
    -   Download: [https://persistent.oaistatic.com/codex-app-prod/Codex.dmg](https://persistent.oaistatic.com/codex-app-prod/Codex.dmg)

## How to Build

Run the rebuild script:

```bash
node rebuild_codex.js
```

This script will:
1.  Mount `Codex.dmg` and extract the app logic (`app.asar`), icon, and configuration.
2.  Download the compatible x64 Electron runtime.
3.  Rebuild native modules (`better-sqlite3`, `node-pty`) for Intel architecture.
4.  Copy the x64 `codex` binary from your local CLI installation.
5.  Generate `Codex_Intel.app`.

## How to Run

Open the generated app:

```bash
open Codex_Intel.app
```

If you see "App is damaged", run:
```bash
xattr -cr Codex_Intel.app
```

## Updates

**Note:** This is a manual port. Auto-updates will **not** work.

To update:
1.  Download the new `Codex.dmg` from OpenAI.
2.  Replace the old `Codex.dmg` in this folder.
3.  Run `node rebuild_codex.js` again.
4.  If the Codex CLI also updated, run `npm update -g @openai/codex` before rebuilding.

## Security Note

The built app launches with the `--no-sandbox` Electron flag via a wrapper script at `Contents/MacOS/Codex`. This disables Chromium's internal process sandbox, which is necessary to allow tools like **Playwright** to spawn browser subprocesses from within the integrated terminal.

This is separate from the macOS Seatbelt sandbox that Codex uses for workspace isolation. To enable network access inside the Codex terminal, set the following in your Codex `config.toml`:

```toml
[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"Operation not permitted"**:
  - The app is self-signed/unsigned. You must remove the quarantine attribute:
    ```bash
    xattr -cr Codex_Intel.app
    ```
  - If Playwright or other tools fail, ensure you are running the app via the wrapper `Contents/MacOS/Codex` (which the `.app` bundle does by default) which adds `--no-sandbox`.

- **Build Failures (Native Modules)**:
  - If you see errors about `source_location` or C++ compilation during `npm install`:
    - Ensure your Xcode Command Line Tools are up to date (Xcode 15+ recommended for C++20 support).
    - The build script attempts to force C++20 mode (`-std=c++20`), which requires a modern compiler.
    - Try running `xcode-select --install` to update your tools.

- **"Could not find local x64 Codex binary"**:
  - The script now searches dynamically for the `codex` binary. Ensure you have the latest version of `@openai/codex` installed globally.
  - Run `npm list -g @openai/codex` to verify installation path.
-   **Blank Window**: Usually means the executable name doesn't match `Info.plist`. The script handles this via a wrapper at `Contents/MacOS/Codex` that launches `Codex.orig`.
-   **Missing Binary**: Ensure the Codex CLI is installed globally (`npm install -g @openai/codex`).
-   **No Network in Terminal**: Set `network_access = true` in your Codex `config.toml` (see Security Note above).
-   **Playwright / Browser Spawning**: Should work out of the box thanks to `--no-sandbox`. If issues persist, ensure network access is enabled.
-   **Crashes**: Check console logs. If `sparkle.node` (auto-updater) crashes, ignore it; the app should still function.
